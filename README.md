### ES6 Arrow Functions

### Assignment Tasks

1.Create a new repo in your GitHub account called arrow-functions. Clone the empty repo to your dev environment.
2.Navigate to the prework folder in the root directory of the class repository. Then navigate into the arrow-functions folder.
3.Copy the contents of the folder named starter-code into your newly-created repo. Make an initial commit with the unchanged starter code.
4.Proceed to work on a well-named branch. As you work, remember to add, commit, and push regularly.
5.The app.js file contains examples of function expressions, as you are accustomed to seeing. Work through steps 1-9, reading the notes and reviewing the refactored samples.
6.For each of these steps, uncomment the console.log line. Open the index.html file in the browser and verify the correct output in the developer console.
7.To complete step 10, refactor the function expressions one at a time. Uncomment the console.log line and use it to check that the output is the same after you have completed the refactoring process.
8.To complete step 11, uncomment the two console.log lines and observe the output in the developer console in the browser. Answer the corresponding questions.
